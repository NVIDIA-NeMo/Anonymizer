## Description: <br>
Use when the user wants to anonymize a text dataset, redact PII, de-identify free-text data, or rewrite text to remove sensitive or inferable identifying information. Produces a runnable Python script that calls the NeMo Anonymizer pipeline (detection → replace or rewrite). <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and data engineers who need to anonymize text datasets containing PII, using LLM-powered entity detection and replacement or context-aware rewriting to de-identify free-text data. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Yes] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [API key] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
6 evaluation tasks (4 positive, 2 negative) with 3 attempts per task in isolated sandbox pods. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill avoids unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was selected and activated when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the user's goal (goal completion 50% + expected workflow adherence 50%). <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoided wasted tool calls and token usage (tool productivity 50% + token efficiency 50%). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity; routing is scored under Discoverability. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
